PURPOSE OF SCRIPT
==================
This is a basic script that sends email with attachments from the command line, its been tested using gmail, but it should not be difficult to customize and use your prefered email service.

SETUP
==================
Since google does not allow smtp logins, as they consider them "lesss secure", you have to allow this type of access, by:
1. Logging into your gmail account
2.Going to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps while logged in and enabling access for less secure apps.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT
==================
You can run the script in two ways:
1. python email_attachment_sender.py -d "destination_email_address" -t "email_subject" -m "email_message" -f "file_to_attach"

2. Grant the script execute permissions then on your terminal:
	(a) chmod +x email_attachment_sender.py
	(b)./email_attachment_sender.py -d "destination_email_address" -t "email_subject" -m "email_message" -f "file_to_attach"

OTHER USES
================
The info in the script can be hardcoded if all you wish to do is have an automated email script.
